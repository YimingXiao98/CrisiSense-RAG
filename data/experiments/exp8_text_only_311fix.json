The call for Harris County property owners to use an app to report property damage (Tweets [904122831713251328], [904123475685777409]) and the Department of Neighborhoods' active flood damage assessments (Tweet [905820640015511552]) further support a high percentage of properties affected by flooding.

Another 'unknown' 311 call for 'Traffic Signs' also points to potential road infrastructure damage. While no specific road names are mentioned as impacted, the consistent 'Bridge and Barricade' reports indicate widespread issues. The sensor data provided (IDs 140, 160) showing 0.0 inches of rainfall on 2017-09-09 and 2017-09-10 is outside the specified time window (2017-09-01 to 2017-09-07) and therefore does not contribute to the impact assessment during this period, but rather confirms the cessation of heavy rainfall in the days immediately following.",

Tweets from the area, such as ID 901826476210876417 and 903399005224357889, characterized the event as 'historic flooding' and a '1,000-year flood event', leading to widespread destruction as noted in Tweet ID 903081533124247553.\nDamage Estimate: 75.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825, 901629053211480066\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets confirms significant flood impact within ZIP 77045. Tweet ID 902539673364516864 specifically reports 'street flooded' at '4622 knotty oaks trail 77045' and a 'transform blowed'. Other tweets from within the ZIP, such as 901826476210876417 and 903399005224357889, describe Hurricane Harvey as unleashing 'historic flooding' and being a '1,000-year flood event' across the Houston area, which would encompass 77045. Tweet ID 903081533124247553 generally states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity'. The prevalence of 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' (Call IDs 101002719328, 101002719776) strongly indicates that multiple roads and bridges were impacted, likely due to flooding or damage. Additionally, Call ID 101002719744 reports damage to a 'Sprinkler or irrigation system in City Park', suggesting infrastructure damage beyond just roads. The consistent reporting of flooding and damage from multiple sources within the specified time frame points to widespread and severe impact.",

        "formatted": "Summary: In ZIP 77006, from September 1st to September 7th, 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused extensive flood and property damage. Numerous tweets reported widespread 'water damage' that 'extended far beyond flood zones,' indicating a significant impact on properties, including businesses (e.g., Tweet IDs 903823717926567936, 903992796763348992, 905120736003727362). The Department of Neighborhoods was actively assessing 'flood damage' (Tweet ID 905820640015511552). Consequently, approximately 75% of properties are estimated to have experienced flood-related impact. Multiple 311 calls with 'unknown' IDs regarding 'Bridge and Barricade' issues suggest disruptions to local roads and infrastructure. Specifically, 'flood damage assessment' was reported for the Fondren and Bissonnet areas (Tweet ID 904837837140484096), indicating these roads were impacted.\nDamage Estimate: 75.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 903419965331697664, 903422881648054277, 903460810483265540, 903656280010711042, 903823717926567936\nReasoning: The analysis of Tweets and 311 Calls for ZIP 77006 during the specified time window indicates widespread and severe impact from Hurricane Harvey. Numerous tweets describe extensive 'Harvey damage', 'flood damage', and 'water damage' that 'extended far beyond flood zones' (e.g., Tweet IDs 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992). Reports also mention 'property damage' (e.g., Tweet IDs 904122831713251328, 904123475685777409) and 'Harvey flood waters damage Houston businesses' (Tweet ID 905120736003727362). Furthermore, Tweet ID 905820640015511552 notes that 'Dept of Neighborhoods #Harvey flood damage assessments' were in progress. These reports collectively suggest a high percentage of properties experiencing flood-related damage.\n\nRegarding roads, multiple 311 calls with 'unknown' IDs reported 'Bridge and Barricade' issues, which strongly implies disruptions or damage to local infrastructure and roads. Additionally, Tweet ID 904837837140484096 explicitly mentions a 'flood damage assessment' in the 'Fondren and Bissonnet area', indicating these specific roads were impacted. The sensor data provided is outside the specified time window (2017-09-10 vs 2017-09-01 to 2017-09-07) and thus not relevant for this analysis.",

Furthermore, multiple 311 calls (all with unknown IDs) requesting \"Bridge and Barricade\" indicate that roads and bridges were impacted and likely impassable, requiring closures.

Tweets confirm widespread and severe flooding in the Houston area, with specific mentions of \"historic flooding\" (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417) and the city being a \"flooding city\" on August 30th (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553).

Furthermore, multiple 311 calls (all with unknown IDs) requesting \"Bridge and Barricade\" indicate that roads and bridges were impacted and likely impassable, requiring closures. Other 311 calls requesting \"Protect City Trees\" suggest tree damage, a common effect of strong winds and saturated ground during a hurricane.
