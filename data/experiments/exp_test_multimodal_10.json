Satellite imagery confirmed substantial flooding near Buffalo Bayou, particularly affecting local roads and parkland, but did not reveal any significant structural damage to buildings or homes.\nDamage Estimate: 70.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: Residents in ZIP 77022 reported 'historic flooding' and 'flood damage' through social media and 311 calls. Specific complaints were made regarding extensive water damage related to Hurricane Harvey, suggesting a severe impact on infrastructure. However, high-resolution satellite imagery shows significant localized flooding along the Buffalo Bayou and surrounding areas, yet no visible structural damage was detected in the buildings or homes based on the imagery analysis. The imagery reveals widespread road inundation, which correlates with the text reports of impacted roads but contrasts with claims of severe structural damage, leading to the conclusion that while flooding is substantial, the structural impact is minimal.",
