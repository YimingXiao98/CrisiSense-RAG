Numerous 311 calls for 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., 311_12164467-101002723606, 311_12165838-101002728360) indicate extensive road and infrastructure disruptions, while a direct call to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (311_101002727723) further confirms local flood impact needing official record.",

Approximately 50% of the ZIP area is estimated to have been impacted by floodwaters due to the extensive nature of the damage reported.\nDamage Estimate: 50.0%\nConfidence: 0.8\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets and 311 calls for ZIP 77017 during the specified time window reveals widespread flood and storm damage. Multiple tweets emphasize 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., tweet_903823717926567936, tweet_903992796763348992), indicating that damage was not confined to traditional flood-prone areas but was extensive throughout the region. Reports mention 'unbelievable' damage (tweet_903656280010711042), 'property damage' (tweet_904122831713251328, tweet_905920666096078848), and damage to 'Houston businesses' (tweet_905120736003727362). The city's Department of Neighborhoods was actively conducting 'flood damage assessments' and urging residents to 'Report flood damage to 311' (tweet_905820640015511552). Correspondingly, 311 calls in the ZIP code include direct reports to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (311_101002730064). Additionally, several 311 calls for 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., 311_12166690-101002731433, 311_101002738374) suggest infrastructure issues and potential road closures due to the storm's impact. The sensor data provided is from after the time window and shows no activity, thus not relevant for impact assessment during the specified period. Given the repeated emphasis on widespread damage beyond flood zones and calls for damage assessment and reporting, a significant portion of the ZIP is inferred to have been impacted by floodwaters.",

Multiple tweets describe 'historic flooding' (tweet_901826476210876417) and 'unbelievable damage' (tweet_903656280010711042) across Houston, with specific mentions of 'water damage extended far beyond flood zones' (e.g., tweet_903823717926567936). One tweet directly states 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' (tweet_903081533124247553). The proximity of Bellaire, TX, also reported to have extensive flood damage (tweet_903028781920788480), suggests similar impacts in 77087. Nine 311 calls specifically reported 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., 311_12164467-101002723606, 311_12166290-101002729907), strongly indicating widespread road closures and impassable infrastructure due to flooding. Rainfall gauges in nearby areas, specifically Sims Bayou @ Telephone Road (Sensor 340) and I-45 S @ HWY 610 HOV (Sensor 4850), reported extremely high totals: 18.92 inches and 19.48 inches respectively on August 27th, followed by significant additional rainfall on August 28th and 29th. These rainfall amounts are consistent with the '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' mentioned in tweet_903399005224357889, corroborating severe and extensive flooding within the ZIP code.",

Further evidence of impact on infrastructure comes from numerous 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., 311_12164975-101002725961 through 311_12166763-101002731666), indicating multiple impassable roads and bridges.

The extent of the damage is described as 'unbelievable' (tweet_903656280010711042). Supporting these reports are numerous 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., 311_12164975-101002725961 through 311_12166763-101002731666), indicating significant impact on transportation infrastructure. A rainfall gauge in the region reported 5.32 inches on August 29th (gauge_1620_2017-08-29), confirming heavy precipitation that would contribute to such widespread flooding.",

Other tweets, including [tweet_901849278003372034] and [tweet_903081533124247553], generally report 'Hurricane Harvey damage' and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' within the context of ZIP 77020. Several tweets [tweet_901917030970003457], [tweet_901952108655775744] suggest the flood damage may match Katrina in scale. \n\nDirect evidence of flood damage in the ZIP is supported by a 311 call [311_101002729143] to 'Document damage by storm or flood.' Additionally, numerous 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., [311_12164467-101002723606], [311_12164586-101002724020], [311_12164892-101002725533], [311_12164975-101002725961], [311_12165335-101002726928], [311_12165476-101002727284], [311_12165614-101002727704], [311_12165838-101002728360]) indicate significant impacts on local infrastructure and roadways, necessitating closures or caution. While one tweet [tweet_902182575875219456] mentioned 'Road don't look bad' for a specific location within 77020, the overall body of evidence points to widespread and severe flooding and associated damage.",

Road infrastructure was severely impacted, evidenced by nine 311 calls reporting \"Bridge and Barricade\" issues (311_12164975-101002725961 through 311_12166763-101002731666), indicating road closures and damage, particularly affecting areas with bridges.\nDamage Estimate: 35.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: The zip code 77013 experienced severe and widespread flooding during the specified time window, driven by significant rainfall. Rainfall gauges reported over 6 inches of rain on August 29, 2017, at nearby locations (Sensors 820, 4810). On-the-ground reports confirm critical conditions, with a tweet from August 29 (tweet_902711251444400133) detailing \"chest level\" water at 9722 Aguila Dr, necessitating the rescue of two seniors in wheelchairs. Multiple tweets between August 29 and September 1 (tweet_902889458860785664, tweet_902933605168685056, tweet_902946518239387648, tweet_902967918874562560) indicate flood damage to the Theater District Houston. General sentiments across various tweets describe \"historic flooding\" (tweet_902835549135917056), \"unbelievable damage\" (tweet_903656280010711042), and that \"Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones\" (tweet_903823717926567936, tweet_903834779384254465, tweet_903942638411374592, tweet_903992796763348992).

A 311 call (`311_101002737539`) directly reported 'damage by storm or flood'. Authorities were actively assessing flood damage and surveying impacted homes (e.g., `tweet_905820640015511552`, `tweet_906567125384364032`). Roads and bridges were also impacted, particularly in the 'Fondren and Bissonnet area' (`tweet_904837837140484096`), and numerous 311 calls for 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., `311_12167750-101002734684`) suggest widespread infrastructure issues. Additionally, calls for 'Missed Heavy Trash Pick Up' (e.g., `311_101002733649`) and 'violations of the Health and Sanitation Code' (e.g., `311_101002734924`) point to significant post-flood recovery challenges and sanitation concerns. Rainfall sensor data indicated no active rain on September 10, 2017.\nDamage Estimate: 30.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets and 311 calls for ZIP 77048 during September 4-10, 2017, indicates widespread impact from Hurricane Harvey. Multiple tweets (e.g., tweet_904837837140484096, tweet_905160043183693824, tweet_905430986497945600, tweet_905920666096078848, tweet_906480493083983872) explicitly mention 'flood damage' and 'house damage' within the ZIP code. The tweet_904837837140484096 specifically points to flood damage assessment in the 'Fondren and Bissonnet area'. Authorities were conducting 'flood damage assessments' (tweet_905820640015511552) and encouraging residents to report damage (tweet_906567125384364032, tweet_905524226022674436), reinforcing the pervasive nature of the damage. A key 311 call (311_101002737539) directly reports 'damage by storm or flood'.\n\nInfrastructure was also affected, evidenced by multiple 'Bridge and Barricade' 311 calls (e.g., 311_12167750-101002734684, 311_12168320-101002736913, 311_101002738374, 311_12169274-101002741279), suggesting road closures or damage to bridges. Post-flood recovery issues are indicated by 311 calls for 'Missed Heavy Trash Pick Up (alternating Tree and Junk Waste)' (e.g., 311_101002733649, 311_101002743381) and 'violations of the Health and Sanitation Code' (e.g., 311_101002734924, 311_101002735543), consistent with flood aftermath. Sensor data for rainfall shows 0.0 inches by the end of the period, indicating no active rainfall at that specific time, which doesn't contradict prior flood events.",

Tweets reported 'historic flooding' (tweet_902835549135917056) and 'widespread flood damage' affecting areas like the Theater District Houston (e.g., tweet_902889458860785664) and Bellaire, Texas, with one tweet noting 'Harvey spared few' (tweet_903028781920788480), suggesting broad impact beyond typical flood zones. This points to a significant percentage of the area being affected by floodwaters. Furthermore, numerous 311 calls mentioning 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., 311_12164586-101002724020, 311_12166300-101002729936) indicate that multiple roads and bridges were impacted, likely requiring closure or attention due to damage or high water levels. Calls also reported 'Damage to City Trees' (e.g., 311_334241-101002724545). The intensity of the event was characterized as a '1,000-year flood' (tweet_903399005224357889).\nDamage Estimate: 70.0%\nConfidence: 0.85\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets from ZIP 77833 indicates widespread and severe flooding and damage during Hurricane Harvey. Tweets consistently mention 'Hurricane Harvey impact in Houston' (tweet_901976639000760320), 'historic flooding' (tweet_902835549135917056), and 'flood damage' affecting areas like the Theater District Houston (e.g., tweet_902889458860785664, tweet_902933605168685056, tweet_902946518239387648, tweet_902967918874562560) and Bellaire, Texas, with 'no words for the amount of flood damage' and noting 'Harvey spared few' (tweet_903028781920788480). Multiple tweets also highlight that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., tweet_903823717926567936, tweet_903834779384254465, tweet_903942638411374592, tweet_903992796763348992). The event is described as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (tweet_903399005224357889). Additionally, 311 calls from the same ZIP code frequently report issues related to 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., 311_12164586-101002724020, 311_12164892-101002725533, 311_12164975-101002725961, 311_12165335-101002726928, 311_12165476-101002727284, 311_12165614-101002727704, 311_12165838-101002728360, 311_12166290-101002729907, 311_12166300-101002729936), implying significant disruption and potential damage to roadways and bridges requiring closures or attention. Calls also mention 'Damage to City Trees in the ROW' (e.g., 311_334241-101002724545, 311_334244-101002724548, 311_334671-101002732811).

Calls for 'Traffic Signs' (311_1406307-101002730016) and 'Traffic Signal Maintenance' (311_101002730018) further point to disruptions in local transportation.

A rainfall gauge reported 0.16 inches on 2017-09-06 (gauge_1050_2017-09-06), which while not a major flood event on its own, could contribute to existing water issues or slow drainage in an already impacted area.

Local authorities were actively conducting 'flood damage assessments' and urging residents to 'Report flood damage to 311' (tweet_905820640015511552).

Additionally, calls concerning 'Traffic Signs' (311_1406307-101002730016) and 'Traffic Signal Maintenance' (311_101002730018) further indicate disruptions to transportation. A minor rainfall of 0.16 inches was recorded on September 6th (gauge_1050_2017-09-06), potentially exacerbating existing water issues. Other 311 calls point to 'Damage to City Trees' (311_334671-101002732811) and issues like 'Missed Heavy Trash Pick Up' (311_101002733649) and 'Code Violation Report' (311_67723-101002734487), likely stemming from the storm's aftermath."

A call regarding 'Damage to City Trees' (311_334671-101002732811) indicates environmental damage. A rainfall gauge reported 0.16 inches on 2017-09-06 (gauge_1050_2017-09-06), which while not a major flood event on its own, could contribute to existing water issues or slow drainage in an already impacted area.

The severity of the flooding is further corroborated by numerous 311 calls for 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., 311_12162603-101002719328, 311_12162747-101002719776, 311_12164467-101002723606, 311_12164586-101002724020, 311_12164892-101002725533, 311_12164975-101002725961, 311_12165335-101002726928, 311_12165476-101002727284), indicating roads and possibly bridges were impassable or damaged, requiring official closure. Calls also reported damage to city park sprinkler systems (311_101002719744) and city trees (311_334166-101002720909, 311_334241-101002724545, 311_334244-101002724548).

Overall, an estimated 60% of the ZIP code area was impacted by floodwaters, with widespread road closures and infrastructure damage.\nDamage Estimate: 60.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: Torrential rainfall was recorded in and around ZIP 77546 during the specified time window, with several local gauges reporting significant accumulations. Sensor 130 and Sensor 120, for example, each reported over 21 inches of rain on August 27th alone, followed by several more days of heavy rainfall (e.g., Sensor 120 recorded 10.24 inches on Aug 28 and 7.00 inches on Aug 29; Sensor 125 reported 15.52 inches on Aug 27, 8.12 inches on Aug 28 and Aug 29). This aligns with on-the-ground reports from tweets confirming 'historic flooding in Houston area' (tweet_901826476210876417) and an overall 'flooding city' (tweet_903081533124247553). Multiple tweets also directly referenced 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (tweet_901849278003372034) and 'flood damage' (tweet_901917030970003457, tweet_901952108655775744). One tweet specifically noted 'no words for the amount of flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few' (tweet_903028781920788480), indicating widespread impact in areas adjacent to or within the broader Houston metropolitan area.
