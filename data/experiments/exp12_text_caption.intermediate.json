Tweets consistently indicate severe and widespread flooding, using phrases such as 'historic flooding' (Tweet IDs 901826476210876417, 902835549135917056), 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID 901849278003372034), 'flood damage may match Katrina' (Tweet IDs 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744), 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' (Tweet ID 903081533124247553), and 'Harvey is a 1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID 903399005224357889).

Several other 311 calls reported 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (multiple instances with 'unknown' IDs), directly indicating disruption to roads and transportation infrastructure.

Based on the volume and severity of these reports, an estimated 75% of the area was impacted by flooding, with King Pkwy specifically identified as affected.\nDamage Estimate: 75.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901976639000760320, 902177645340889089, 902680538586238981, 902835549135917056, 902889458860785664\nReasoning: Analysis of Twitter reports indicates widespread and historic flooding, with multiple mentions of 'flood damage' and 'destroyed a lot' within and around ZIP 77004.

A 311 call (ID 101002731478) explicitly requested to 'Document damage by storm or flood,' confirming active damage reporting. Road infrastructure was significantly affected, with multiple 311 calls (including IDs 101002731433 and 101002736913) reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' issues. Additionally, tweet 904837837140484096 mentioned 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment,' identifying specific major roads impacted by flooding. The overwhelming evidence from both sources suggests a high percentage of properties suffered flood damage, and key transportation routes were disrupted.\nDamage Estimate: 70.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 903419965331697664, 903422881648054277, 903460810483265540, 903656280010711042, 903823717926567936\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets and 311 calls for ZIP code 77089 during the specified time window indicates significant and widespread impact from Hurricane Harvey. Multiple tweets (e.g., 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992) explicitly state that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones,' implying a high percentage of properties experienced water damage regardless of their typical flood susceptibility. Further confirmation of property damage comes from tweets mentioning 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' (904487470984830976, 905920666096078848) and the existence of a 'property damage app for Harris County property owners' (904122831713251328, 904123475685777409). A 311 call (ID 101002731478) directly requested to 'Document damage by storm or flood,' reinforcing the presence of storm-related damage. The term '1,000-year flood event' (903422881648054277) further emphasizes the scale of the flooding. Roads were significantly impacted, as evidenced by numerous 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (IDs 101002731433, 101002736913, and others without specific IDs), suggesting closures or damage to bridges and roadways. Tweet 904837837140484096 specifically mentions 'Fondren and Bissonnet area flood damage assessment SW side of Houston,' identifying two major thoroughfares affected by flooding.

On-the-ground reports from Tweets indicated widespread 'historic flooding' and damage across the Houston area (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417). A direct report from 77099 confirmed a power outage in the area (Tweet ID: 902169395060985856). Tweets also described 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034) and a 'floodingcity' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553). While some reports mentioned flood damage in the Theater District of Houston (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560) and severe flood damage in nearby Bellaire (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), these underscore the broad and severe nature of the flooding. Multiple 311 calls from ZIP 77099 explicitly reported 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., Call ID: 101002727704, and several calls with 'unknown' IDs), confirming that roads were impacted. Furthermore, a 311 call specifically requested to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (Call ID: 101002731640), providing direct evidence of flood-related harm within the ZIP code. Based on these reports, it is estimated that approximately 80% of the area experienced flood impact, with multiple unspecified roads affected. Confidence in these estimates is high due to the direct and corroborating evidence from both Tweets and 311 calls."

        "formatted": "Summary: During the time window of August 28 to September 3, 2017, ZIP 77091 experienced severe and widespread flood damage due to Hurricane Harvey. Multiple on-the-ground reports from tweets characterized the event as 'historic flooding' and an '800-year' or '1,000-year flood event' (Tweet IDs 902177645340889089, 903399005224357889). Residents reported 'unbelievable damage' (Tweet ID 903656280010711042), with one tweet stating that 'Harvey destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID 903081533124247553).

The widespread nature of the damage is emphasized by reports of 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., Tweet IDs 903823717926567936, 903992796763348992). Multiple 311 calls specifically request to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (Call IDs 101002727376, 101002729038), providing direct evidence of local damage. Furthermore, numerous 311 calls concerning 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., Call ID 101002727704) strongly indicate issues with road infrastructure, likely due to flooding or debris.

Given this consistent evidence of widespread and severe water damage, a high flood impact percentage is estimated.

The sensor data provided for September 10, 2017, was outside the specified time window and not considered for this analysis.\nDamage Estimate: 80.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 903419965331697664, 903422881648054277, 903460810483265540, 903656280010711042, 903823717926567936\nReasoning: The estimation of flood impact is primarily based on numerous tweets from ZIP 77006 within the specified time window. Multiple tweets, such as [903823717926567936], [903834779384254465], [903942638411374592], and [903992796763348992], state that \"Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones,\" indicating widespread and significant water-related damage beyond expected areas. Other tweets like [905120736003727362] confirm \"Harvey flood waters damage Houston businesses,\" which applies to ZIP 77006. The overall sentiment from tweets [903422881648054277] describing Harvey as a \"1,000-year flood event\" and [903656280010711042] mentioning \"unbelievable damage\" reinforces the scale of impact. Calls to report property damage via an app [904122831713251328] and to 311 for flood damage assessments [905820640015511552] further confirm the prevalence of damage. Given this consistent evidence of widespread and severe water damage, a high flood impact percentage is estimated. Road impact is inferred from multiple 311 calls (referenced as 'unknown' IDs in the input) specifically reporting \"Bridge and Barricade\" issues, which suggest that bridges were either damaged or rendered impassable, and barricades were necessary on roadways due to conditions. Sensor data provided is for 2017-09-10, which falls outside the specified time window of 2017-09-01 to 2017-09-07, and therefore was not used in this assessment.",

Tweets confirm 'historic flooding' in the Houston area (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417) and widespread 'flood damage' (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744). Specific reports mention 'flood damage' in the nearby Bellaire area (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480) and Houston's Theater District (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560), indicating the widespread nature of the disaster affecting the greater Houston area including 77546. Multiple 311 calls from ZIP 77546 for 'Bridge and Barricade' (Call IDs: 101002719328, 101002719776, plus other un-numbered calls) directly suggest that roads and infrastructure were impacted, likely requiring closures due to floodwaters or damage. Reports of damage to City Trees and city park sprinkler systems (Call ID: 101002719744, plus other un-numbered calls) further corroborate physical damage in the area. Given the confluence of these severe indicators, a high percentage of flood impact is estimated.",
