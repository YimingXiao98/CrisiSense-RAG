Tweets mention widespread 'flood damage' and state that Harvey 'destroyed a lot' and 'spared few,' indicating severe and extensive inundation. Specific mentions of 'Theater District Houston suffers flood damage' (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902967918874562560) indicate significant impact in urban areas. Several tweets also note that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (Tweet IDs: 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992). The strong, consistent language across multiple reports supports a very high flood impact percentage. No specific road names were identified as impacted, but the general widespread nature of the flooding, including in the Theater District, implies that roads throughout the area were affected. There were no 311 calls or relevant sensor data within the specified time window.",

Reports of \"Hurricane Harvey House Damage\" (904487470984830976, 905920666096078848) confirm residential impact, and the mention of ongoing \"flood damage assessments\" by the Department of Neighborhoods (905820640015511552) signifies the extensive nature of the damage.

Tweets referred to Harvey as an '800-year flood' (ID 902177645340889089) and a '1,000-year flood event' (ID 903399005224357889), indicating an extreme and widespread event. Multiple reports confirmed 'flood damage' (IDs 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056, 902946518239387648, 902967918874562560, 903028781920788480) and 'water damage' extending 'far beyond flood zones' (IDs 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992). The mention of '1704 Warwick road 77093' (ID 902537102696566784) suggests a specific road or address experienced an incident, likely flood-related given the context.

Tweet [903028781920788480] speaks of 'flood damage I've seen up close... Harvey spared few,' suggesting extensive property impact. Another tweet notes 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' [903081533124247553]. Crucially, several reports (e.g., [903823717926567936], [903834779384254465], [903942638411374592], [903992796763348992]) explicitly state 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones,' indicating that the flooding was not limited to traditionally vulnerable areas but was extremely widespread, affecting a high percentage of the ZIP code. The cumulative evidence from these tweets points to a very high proportion of properties and infrastructure being impacted by flooding.",
