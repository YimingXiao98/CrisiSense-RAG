However, satellite imagery indicates localized flooding primarily around waterways and does not confirm significant structural damage or wider inundation. Roads near affected areas may face access issues, but major thoroughfares appear clear.\nDamage Estimate: 45.0%\nConfidence: 0.95\nCited Tweets: 903081533124247553, 903311548877344769, 903656280010711042, 905160043183693824, 905120736003727362\nReasoning: On-the-ground reports from multiple tweets indicate severe flooding and damage in ZIP 77630. However, high-resolution satellite imagery reveals localized inundation rather than widespread severe flooding or structural damage. While social media reports point to significant flood impact with mentions of destruction, visual analysis confirms flooding primarily affects low-lying areas and infrastructure without explicit structural damage. This discrepancy requires a downgrade in the severity of the flooding impact as observed in the imagery.",
