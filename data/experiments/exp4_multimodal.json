Specific localized reports mention the Theater District in Houston suffering from significant flood damage (Tweet IDs: 902889458860785664, 902933605168685056). Although text reports indicate widespread impact, visual analysis shows high-confidence satellite imagery confirming significant flooding in residential areas and the golf course, yet no visible structural damage observed (Imagery Tile IDs: 20170831bC0953430w294630n, 20170831bC0953300w294630n, 20170831bC0953130w294630n, 20170831bC0953000w294630n). Therefore, while flooding is confirmed, the consistent absence of structural damage in the imagery reduces the reported severity of the situation.",
