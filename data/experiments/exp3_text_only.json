Specific mentions of \"Hurricane Harvey House Damage\" (904487470984830976, 905920666096078848) further confirm direct property impact. The ongoing \"flood damage assessments\" and calls to \"Report flood damage to 311\" by the Department of Neighborhoods (905820640015511552) in Harris County also indicate that widespread damage was expected and being actively documented.

Tweets mention 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 902835549135917056), 'destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553), and 'unbelievable' damage (Tweet ID: 903656280010711042). Crucially, multiple tweets (Tweet IDs: 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992) report that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones', suggesting that even areas not typically prone to flooding were affected. This widespread impact, described as a '1,000-year flood event' (Tweet ID: 903399005224357889), implies that a significant portion of ZIP 77080 would have experienced flood damage. There are no specific reports of roads impacted within 77080, nor are there any 311 calls or relevant sensor data for the specified time window.",
