A key indicator of severe impact is the repeated mention that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., Tweet IDs [903823717926567936], [903992796763348992]), suggesting extensive inundation. On the ground, numerous 311 calls for 'Bridge and Barricade' (Call IDs [unknown] x9) point to significant disruption and damage to road infrastructure. Furthermore, two 311 calls explicitly requested to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (Call IDs [unknown] x2), directly confirming storm and flood-related damage. Additional calls regarding 'Damage to City Trees' (Call IDs [unknown] x2) suggest broader environmental impacts.

Tweets extensively describe 'historic flooding' and 'Hurricane Harvey damage' in the Houston area, with several indicating widespread 'flood damage from Harvey' and that 'Harvey destroyed a lot' (e.g., Tweet IDs [901826476210876417], [901849278003372034], [901917030970003457], [901952108655775744], [903081533124247553]). A key indicator of severe impact is the repeated mention that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., Tweet IDs [903823717926567936], [903992796763348992]), suggesting extensive inundation. On the ground, numerous 311 calls for 'Bridge and Barricade' (Call IDs [unknown] x9) point to significant disruption and damage to road infrastructure. Furthermore, two 311 calls explicitly requested to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (Call IDs [unknown] x2), directly confirming storm and flood-related damage. Additional calls regarding 'Damage to City Trees' (Call IDs [unknown] x2) suggest broader environmental impacts.

Some tweets also refer to Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (Tweet ID 903399005224357889). Additionally, 311 calls from the ZIP code specifically request to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (multiple calls, e.g., 'Document damage by storm or flood-101002727224'), reinforcing the presence of significant damage. Multiple 'Bridge and Barricade' 311 calls also point to compromised infrastructure and road closures. The sensor data provided for 2017-09-10 shows 0.0 rainfall, which is outside the specified time window and not relevant for impact assessment during 2017-08-26 to 2017-09-01.",

Official sources like the Harris County Appraisal District and Department of Neighborhoods were actively involved in damage assessment and encouraged residents to report flood damage (Tweet IDs 905524226022674436, 905820640015511552, 906567125384364032). These reports are strongly corroborated by 311 calls, which include direct requests to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (Call IDs 101002738091, 101002740087), 'Code Violation Report for Multi-Family Housing' (Call ID 101002738730) and 'Violation of the Minimum Standards Housing Code for Single Family Buildings', suggesting significant structural issues. Additionally, multiple 'Bridge and Barricade' 311 calls (e.g., Call IDs 101002736913, 101002741279) confirm impact on road infrastructure. The high volume and consistent nature of these reports across different channels justify a high confidence in the estimated widespread flood impact and road issues. Sensor data shows 0.0 inches of rainfall, indicating that while active rainfall had ceased, the period was focused on damage assessment and recovery from prior flooding.",

Multiple 311 calls in ZIP 77035 report 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., Call ID: 101002727704, and several 'unknown' IDs), directly indicating road and infrastructure impact. Additionally, 311 calls to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (Call IDs: 101002727274, 101002728535) confirm property and area-wide damage reports. The provided sensor data is outside the specified time window and does not offer relevant information for the impact during 2017-08-26 to 2017-09-01.",

Other tweets, such as 901826476210876417 and 903081533124247553, refer to 'historic flooding' and 'Hurricane Harvey destroyed a lot #floodingcity' within the broader Houston area, indicating widespread severe conditions impacting this ZIP code. Tweet ID 901952250620379136 notes the expectation of flooding in 'my area' (77045) with Harvey. Multiple 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., Call IDs 101002719328, 101002719776) further suggest road and infrastructure damage or impassibility, likely due to flooding.

Multiple 311 calls concerning \"Bridge and Barricade\" issues (e.g., Call ID 101002727704) indicate significant disruption to roads and bridges. A specific 311 call (Call ID 101002728273) requested documentation of storm or flood damage, confirming direct impact. This collective evidence points to an extremely high flood impact on property and infrastructure.\nDamage Estimate: 85.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417, 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684, 901952108655775744\nReasoning: Multiple tweets from ZIP 77021 and surrounding areas between 2017-08-27 and 2017-09-02 consistently report \"historic flooding\" (Tweet ID 901826476210876417), \"unbelievable damage\" (Tweet ID 903656280010711042), and that Hurricane Harvey \"destroyed a lot\" (Tweet ID 903081533124247553). Several tweets also liken the \"Texas Flood Damage From Harvey\" to that of Katrina (Tweet IDs 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744) and describe Harvey as a \"1,000-year flood event\" (Tweet ID 903399005224357889). Specific reports from the ZIP code mention a need for power restoration at 4931 Gammage St and 4927 Gammage St (Tweet ID 902745578425253888). Numerous 311 calls explicitly report \"Bridge and Barricade\" issues, including one identified as 101002727704, indicating widespread road and bridge disruptions. Another 311 call (ID 101002728273) specifically requested to \"Document damage by storm or flood,\" confirming direct flood impact. The widespread nature of these reports across the time window strongly suggests severe and pervasive flood damage within the ZIP code, impacting infrastructure like roads and power.",

Local 311 calls corroborate these reports, with multiple requests concerning 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., Call ID 101002723370), indicating significant disruption to roads and infrastructure. Additionally, numerous 311 calls were made to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (e.g., Call IDs 101002727503, 101002727616, 101002732793), confirming the need for official assessment of the damage. Given the consistent and severe nature of these on-the-ground reports, an estimated 85% of the area was impacted by flooding, leading to widespread closures and damage to bridges and roads.\nDamage Estimate: 85.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901629053211480066, 901826476210876417, 901849278003372034, 901917030970003457, 901917813392199684\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets and 311 calls for ZIP 77023 during Hurricane Harvey (2017-08-27 to 2017-09-02) indicates widespread and severe flood damage. Tweets repeatedly mention 'historic flooding,' 'unbelievable damage,' and direct 'flood damage' reports. Some tweets compare the damage to Katrina's scale, indicating extreme impact (e.g., Tweet ID 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744). Tweet ID 901629053211480066 mentions ongoing flooding, and Tweet ID 903081533124247553 confirms destruction on August 30, 2017, due to flooding. Several tweets highlight that water damage extended 'far beyond flood zones' (e.g., Tweet ID 903823717926567936). The 311 calls reinforce these observations, with multiple reports for 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., Call ID 101002723370), suggesting significant road and infrastructure disruption. Furthermore, several 311 calls specifically request to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (e.g., Call IDs 101002727503, 101002727616, 101002732793), directly confirming localized damage assessments were necessary.

Specific tweets mention 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet 901849278003372034), 'destroyed a lot' (Tweet 903081533124247553), 'unbelievable damage' (Tweet 903656280010711042), and 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (Tweets 903823717926567936, 903834779384254465, 903942638411374592, 903992796763348992). The 311 calls consistently report 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (multiple calls, e.g., Call ID 101002727704), indicating significant infrastructure disruption affecting roads and bridges. While the provided sensor data is for a later date and shows 0.0 inches, it doesn't contradict the severe flooding reported during the specified time window. The absence of specific street names in the tweets means 'roads_impacted' cannot be precise, but the 311 calls strongly suggest bridge and road closures due to barricade needs.",

        "formatted": "Summary: During Hurricane Harvey (August 25-31, 2017), ZIP 77520 experienced severe and widespread flooding, with an estimated flood impact affecting 85.0% of the area. This is supported by multiple on-the-ground reports from tweets describing 'historic flooding' (Tweet ID: 901826476210876417), 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (Tweet ID: 901849278003372034), and widespread destruction, noting that Harvey 'destroyed a lot' (Tweet ID: 903081533124247553) and 'spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480). Several tweets also drew comparisons between the 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey' and Hurricane Katrina (Tweet IDs: 901917030970003457, 901952108655775744). Additionally, 311 calls frequently reported issues related to 'Bridge and Barricade' (Call IDs: 101002719328, 101002719776), indicating that bridges and roads were significantly impacted and likely required closures or repairs. The sensor data provided falls outside the specified time window and thus does not contribute to this impact assessment.\nDamage Estimate: 85.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nCited Tweets: 901086383942639617, 901377628594196481, 901377762476392449, 901479837122125825, 901629053211480066\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets from ZIP 77520 during the specified time window reveals widespread reports of severe flooding and damage. Tweets consistently mention 'historic flooding' ([901826476210876417]), 'Hurricane Harvey damage' ([901849278003372034]), and 'destroyed a lot' ([903081533124247553]), with some even comparing the 'Texas Flood Damage From Harvey' to 'Katrina' ([901917030970003457], [901952108655775744]). There are also mentions of the area flooding 'badly cause damage' ([901479837122125825]) and that 'Harvey spared few' in terms of flood damage ([903028781920788480]). Numerous 311 calls reported 'Bridge and Barricade' issues ([101002719328], [101002719776]), indicating significant impact on local infrastructure, specifically bridges and roads, likely due to flooding, requiring barricades.

Multiple tweets, including '903572820738932736', '904487470984830976', '905160043183693824', '905430986497945600', and '905920666096078848', explicitly mention 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' or 'Home Damage.' Additionally, tweets like '903823717926567936', '903834779384254465', '903942638411374592', and '903992796763348992' emphasize 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones,' suggesting widespread water-related impact on properties. While no specific flood depth is reported, the repeated mentions of house/home damage imply a significant percentage of properties experienced flood impact.\n311 calls indicate disruptions to road infrastructure. Several calls for 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., '101002731433', '101002736913', and multiple unnumbered calls) suggest potential road closures or damage to bridges. Reports of 'Traffic Signs' (unnumbered call) and 'Traffic Signal Maintenance' ('101002730018') further support issues with traffic control and road functionality. A call about 'Missed Heavy Trash Pick Up (alternating Tree and Junk Waste)' ('101002733649') could imply significant debris needing removal, potentially impacting accessibility.\nDamage Estimate: 20.0%\nConfidence: 0.7\nCited Tweets: 903419965331697664, 903460810483265540, 903572820738932736, 903656280010711042, 903823717926567936\nReasoning: Tweets repeatedly indicate 'Hurricane Harvey House Damage' and 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' within or referencing ZIP 77386 during the specified time window. This suggests widespread property damage due to water, even outside traditional flood areas. 311 calls provide evidence of impacted road infrastructure, with multiple reports of 'Bridge and Barricade' issues, as well as problems with 'Traffic Signs' and 'Traffic Signal Maintenance.' These calls imply road closures or damage and disruptions to traffic flow. A report of 'Missed Heavy Trash Pick Up' also points to significant debris that could impede movement or require cleanup.",

Reports also mention 'flood damage I've seen up close in Bellaire, Texas. Harvey spared few' (Tweet ID: 903028781920788480), indicating widespread impact within the region, including ZIP 77546. The significant number of 311 calls for 'Bridge and Barricade' (Call IDs: 101002719328, 101002719776, plus multiple other un-numbered calls) strongly suggests that numerous roads and bridges were impassable or damaged due to the flooding, requiring barriers and indicating a high impact on local transportation infrastructure. A 311 call (ID: 101002719744) also reported damage to a sprinkler or irrigation system in a city park.",
