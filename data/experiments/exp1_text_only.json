This exceptional rainfall is a primary indicator of severe flooding. On-the-ground reports from tweets corroborate this, describing 'historic flooding' (tweet_901826476210876417) and stating that Harvey 'destroyed a lot' (tweet_903081533124247553).

Property damage reporting was encouraged (tweet_904122831713251328, tweet_904123475685777409, tweet_905820640015511552), and businesses also suffered damage (tweet_905120736003727362). \n\n311 calls corroborate these reports with multiple entries for 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (311_12166690-101002731433, 311_12166763-101002731666, 311_12167750-101002734684, 311_12168320-101002736913, 311_101002738374), directly indicating impact on transportation infrastructure, likely due to floodwaters or damage. A call to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (311_101002732628) confirms active assessment of damage. Furthermore, calls for 'Missed Heavy Trash Pick Up (alternating Tree and Junk Waste)' (311_101002733649, 311_101002733717) and reports of 'Damage to City Trees' (311_334671-101002732811) point to significant debris and tree damage resulting from the storm. Housing-related code violation reports (311_101002734231, 311_67723-101002734487, 311_101002738217) could also be linked to structural damage from the flood. The sensor data provided is dated outside the specified time window (2017-09-10) and shows no rainfall, thus it does not reflect the conditions during the impact period.",

These widespread reports suggest a substantial portion of the ZIP code was inundated.\nDamage Estimate: 75.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: Extensive evidence from tweets and rainfall gauge reports indicates severe, widespread flooding and damage within ZIP 77087 during the specified time window. Rainfall totals reached over 34 inches in nearby gauges (Sensors 340 and 4850) between August 27-29, 2017, confirming historic levels of precipitation. Numerous tweets confirmed from ZIP 77087 describe 'historic flooding' (tweet_901826476210876417), 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (tweet_901849278003372034), 'flood damage' (tweet_901917030970003457, tweet_901952108655775744), 'destroyed a lot' (tweet_903081533124247553), and 'unbelievable' damage (tweet_903656280010711042). Multiple tweets also specifically highlight that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., tweet_903823717926567936), implying pervasive flooding beyond typical risk areas. Furthermore, several 311 calls from within ZIP 77087 reported 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., 311_12164467-101002723606, 311_12164586-101002724020, 311_12164892-101002725533), suggesting significant impact on local infrastructure and roadways.

Multiple 311 calls documented 'Bridge and Barricade' issues (e.g., 311_12164975-101002725961, 311_12166763-101002731666), indicating substantial disruption to road infrastructure. Rainfall data from August 29, 2017, recorded 5.32 inches (gauge_1620_2017-08-29), contributing to the severe flooding. Based on this evidence, an estimated 65% of the ZIP code area was impacted by floodwaters, leading to damage to multiple bridges and roads requiring barricades.\nDamage Estimate: 65.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets and 311 calls for ZIP code 77078 during the specified time window indicates widespread and significant flood impact from Hurricane Harvey. Numerous tweets confirm 'historic flooding' (tweet_902835549135917056) and 'unbelievable damage' (tweet_903656280010711042), describing Harvey as a '1,000-year flood event unprecedented in scale' (tweet_903399005224357889). Critically, multiple tweets report 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., tweet_903823717926567936, tweet_903992796763348992), suggesting widespread inundation beyond typical flood-prone areas. Residents also reported 'flood damage' in the 'Fondren and Bissonnet area SW side of Houston' (tweet_904837837140484096). The high volume of 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., 311_12164975-101002725961, 311_12166763-101002731666) strongly suggests significant disruption to road infrastructure, likely due to flooding or associated damage. Furthermore, rainfall data indicates 5.32 inches on 2017-08-29 (gauge_1620_2017-08-29), contributing to the flooding.",

        "formatted": "Summary: During the period of 2017-09-04 to 2017-09-10, ZIP code 77074 experienced significant post-Hurricane Harvey impact, characterized by widespread flood and property damage. Tweets from the area frequently reported 'flood damage' and 'house damage' (e.g., tweet_905160043183693824, tweet_905430986497945600). Specifically, assessments of flood damage were noted in the 'Fondren and Bissonnet area' (tweet_904837837140484096), indicating impactful flooding affecting major thoroughfares like Fondren Road and Bissonnet Street. Businesses also sustained damage from floodwaters (tweet_905120736003727362). Harris County was actively encouraging residents to report home damage to aid in flood response and assessment (tweet_906567125384364032, tweet_905524226022674436).\n\n311 calls directly confirmed 'damage by storm or flood' (311_101002740873) within the ZIP code. Furthermore, multiple 'Bridge and Barricade' calls (311_101002734684, 311_12168320-101002736913, 311_101002738374, 311_12169274-101002741279) point to compromised or closed roads and infrastructure, likely due to flood damage or ongoing recovery operations. Additional 311 reports concerning 'Code Violation' for both multi-family and single-family housing (311_101002734231, 311_67723-101002734487, 311_101002737933, 311_101002738217) and 'Health and Sanitation Code' violations (311_101002735227, 311_101002736646) underscore the extensive property impact and potential health hazards in the aftermath of the flooding. The available sensor data shows no rainfall during this period, confirming that the reports are detailing damage from the preceding storm.\nDamage Estimate: 35.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: The provided evidence strongly indicates significant and widespread damage from Hurricane Harvey's flooding in ZIP 77074 during the specified time window. Multiple tweets report 'flood damage,' 'house damage,' and 'business damage' (e.g., tweet_905160043183693824, tweet_905430986497945600, tweet_905120736003727362). The tweet_904837837140484096 specifically highlights a 'flood damage assessment' in the 'Fondren and Bissonnet area,' indicating a key intersection with reported impact. Harris County was actively asking residents to report home damage to help improve flood response (tweet_906567125384364032) and had a damage report feature available (tweet_905524226022674436), suggesting widespread impact requiring official tracking. 311 calls corroborate this, with a direct report of 'damage by storm or flood' (311_101002740873). Additionally, several calls for 'Bridge and Barricade' (311_101002734684, 311_12168320-101002736913, 311_101002738374, 311_12169274-101002741279) indicate infrastructure issues, likely related to flood impact or post-flood recovery efforts affecting roads. Reports of 'Code Violation Report for Multi-Family Housing' (311_101002734231, 311_101002737933, 311_101002738217), 'Violation of the Minimum Standards Housing Code for Single Family Buildings' (311_67723-101002734487), and 'Health and Sanitation Code' violations (311_101002735227, 311_101002736646) further suggest widespread property damage and related public health concerns stemming from the storm. The sensor data indicates no active rainfall during this period, reinforcing that these reports are about the aftermath and existing damage from the hurricane.",

Roads, particularly those near bridges, were impacted, leading to numerous 'Bridge and Barricade' calls (e.g., 311_12164467-101002723606, 311_12165838-101002728360) indicating closures or unsafe conditions. Additionally, several 311 calls reported 'Damage to City Trees' (e.g., 311_334166-101002720909).\nDamage Estimate: 65.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: Analysis of tweets and 311 calls confirms significant flood impact in ZIP 77020 during Hurricane Harvey. Multiple tweets describe 'historic flooding' (tweet_901826476210876417, tweet_903399005224357889) and 'unbelievable damage' (tweet_903656280010711042), with explicit mentions of 'Hurricane Harvey damage' (tweet_901849278003372034) and property being 'destroyed a lot' due to flooding (tweet_903081533124247553). One 311 call explicitly requests to 'Document damage by storm or flood' (311_101002729143), corroborating direct flood impact. Additionally, numerous 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., 311_12164467-101002723606, 311_12164586-101002724020, 311_12165838-101002728360) indicate that roads, particularly near bridges, were impacted and required closures or barricading due to unsafe conditions. Although one tweet mentioned 'Road don't look bad' (tweet_902182575875219456), the multiple 311 requests for barricades suggest more widespread or critical road issues. Several 311 calls also reported 'Damage to City Trees' (e.g., 311_334166-101002720909), indicating general storm damage.",

Additionally, multiple 'Violation of the Minimum Standards Housing Code' calls for both single-family and multi-family buildings ([311_67641-101002730500], [311_101002730967], [311_67723-101002734487], [311_101002734231], [311_101002734860]) strongly imply widespread water damage affecting residential properties.

Numerous tweets from within the ZIP confirm 'historic flooding' and 'flood damage,' with reports specifically noting that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., tweet_903823717926567936, tweet_903992796763348992).

Concrete evidence of road impacts comes from multiple 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., 311_12164586-101002724020, 311_12166300-101002729936), indicating numerous road closures or impassable sections. Additionally, calls related to 'Damage to City Trees' (e.g., 311_334241-101002724545) point to fallen trees possibly obstructing roads.\nDamage Estimate: 75.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: The analysis of tweets from within ZIP 77468 indicates widespread and severe flooding due to Hurricane Harvey, consistently described as 'historic flooding' (tweet_902835549135917056) and a '1,000-year flood event' (tweet_903399005224357889). Several reports explicitly state that 'Water Damage From Hurricane Harvey Extended Far Beyond Flood Zones' (e.g., tweet_903823717926567936, tweet_903992796763348992), suggesting a significant portion of the ZIP area was impacted, not just traditional floodplains. The phrase 'Harvey spared few' (tweet_903028781920788480) further reinforces the pervasive nature of the damage. \n\nDirect evidence of infrastructure impact comes from numerous 311 calls reporting 'Bridge and Barricade' (e.g., 311_12164586-101002724020, 311_12166300-101002729936), which strongly implies road closures or impassable routes due to flooding or related damage. Additionally, calls concerning 'Damage to City Trees in the ROW' (e.g., 311_334241-101002724545) suggest tree falls, which could also contribute to road obstructions.
