However, high-resolution satellite imagery indicates no visible structural damage despite significant overbank flooding from Buffalo Bayou, impacting adjacent residential areas and local roads. The flooding appears to be localized and consistent with heavy rainfall runoff rather than widespread damage, which downgrades the severity of the situation. Specific areas like Fondren and Bissonnet reported localized flooding, but visual confirmation shows no structural damage in these locations.",
