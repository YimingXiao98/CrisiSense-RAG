Satellite images confirmed extensive flooding, particularly along Interstate 45, although some residential areas may not have shown flooding in the satellite views. Overall, the evidence suggests that the majority of the area experienced substantial flood damage.\nDamage Estimate: 65.0%\nConfidence: 0.9\nReasoning: The analysis of tweets and 311 calls indicates significant flooding and damage in ZIP 77022 during the time window of August 27 to September 2, 2017. Numerous reports of 'historic flooding' and 'flood damage' highlight the widespread impact, with a confidence level of 0.9. The satellite imagery corroborates these findings by confirming extensive flooding along major roadways, particularly Interstate 45, which was heavily inundated. While some satellite images show areas that appear to be unaffected, the timeline suggests that minor flooding could have occurred in these spots after the capture of the visual data. Therefore, the estimates from the text reports are retained, noting that visual imagery may not capture street-level flooding. The combined evidence leads to a high confidence in the overall flooding in the area.",
