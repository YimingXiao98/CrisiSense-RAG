However, satellite imagery analysis shows extensive water inundation affecting roads and yards but no visible structural damage to buildings. The reliance on visual confirmation suggests that while flooding is present, it does not match the reported damage severity. As a result, the flood impact is confirmed, but the level of structural damage noted in resident reports must be downgraded in light of high-confidence imagery stating no structural damage is visible.",
