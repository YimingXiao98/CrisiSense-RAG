\subsection{Disaster Impact Assessment}
\todo{Review traditional and ML-based disaster assessment methods}

% Placeholder for related work on disaster assessment
Prior work on disaster impact assessment can be broadly categorized into: (1) remote sensing approaches using satellite imagery, (2) social media analysis, and (3) multi-source data fusion. Our work differs by... %TODO: add citations

\subsection{Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation}
\todo{Review RAG literature and multimodal extensions}

% Placeholder for RAG literature
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for grounding large language model outputs in external knowledge. Recent work has extended RAG to multimodal settings. However, existing approaches... %TODO: add citations

\subsection{Vision-Language Models for Document Understanding}
\todo{Review VLM literature relevant to our application}

% Placeholder for VLM literature
Vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V, Gemini, and LLaVA have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding images alongside text. In the context of disaster assessment... %TODO: add citations

% LLM-as-a-Judge section commented out - not used in current experiments
% \subsection{LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation}
% Using large language models as evaluators has gained traction as a scalable 
% alternative to human evaluation. This is implemented in the codebase but not 
% included in the current experimental scope.
