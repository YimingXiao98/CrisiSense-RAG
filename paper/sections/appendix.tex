\section{Tweet Filtering Keywords}
\label{sec:tweet_keywords}

We implemented a keyword-based filtering pipeline to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the 27 million raw tweets. A tweet is included if it contains at least one \textit{allow} keyword and no \textit{block} keywords.

\subsection{Allow List}
\label{sec:allow_list}

Keywords that indicate disaster-relevant content:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
flood & flooding & flooded & hurricane \\
storm & rain & underwater & rescue \\
trapped & stuck & help & emergency \\
911 & evacuate & damage & collapsed \\
power & outage & road & bridge \\
bayou & creek & & \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Block List}
\label{sec:block_list}

During initial corpus exploration, we observed that many tweets containing disaster-related terms (e.g., ``Harvey'', ``Houston'') were unrelated to the hurricane. Common sources of noise included: (1) music promotion and streaming service spam using trending hashtags; (2) political commentary co-opting the disaster for unrelated messaging; (3) commercial advertisements and promotional giveaways; and (4) sports and entertainment discussions. The block list was developed iteratively by examining false positives in the filtered corpus.

Keywords that indicate irrelevant content:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
spotify & music & song & album \\
lyrics & vote & election & trump \\
biden & president & giveaway & contest \\
win & sale & shirt & merch \\
game & nfl & nba & football \\
baseball & love & heart & tears \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This filtering reduced the corpus from 27 million to approximately 450,000 tweets ($\sim$1.7\% acceptance rate).
